## Welcome to My Blog! 🦖

Hello and welcome to **iT-REXpert**, my technical blog where I share my 25 years of experience in Windows system administration.

## Why "The IT Dinosaur"?

After 25 years in IT, I consider myself a technological dinosaur... but in a good way! Like a T-Rex that survived extinction, I've lived through all the IT eras:

- 🦴 **The Batch Script Era**: When everything was done manually
- 🦖 **The PowerShell Revolution**: Windows automation revolution
- 🌋 **Virtualization**: From physical to cloud
- 🌍 **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Ansible, and friends

## My Philosophy

After 25 years in IT, here's what I've learned:

1. **Automation is not optional**: If you do a task more than once, automate it
2. **Documentation is worth gold**: Your future self will thank you
3. **Code must be tested**: Errors are expensive
4. **Simplicity always wins**: Complex code is hard to maintain
5. **Share your knowledge**: The community makes us all better
