## The IT Dinosaur 🦖

Hello, I'm **iT-REXpert**, a Windows system administrator with **25 years of experience** in IT.

Like a dinosaur that survived different technological eras, I've witnessed the evolution of IT infrastructure: from physical servers to cloud, from batch scripts to Infrastructure as Code, and from manual configurations to full automation.

### My Expertise

- **Windows Server Administration**: Active Directory, GPO, WSUS, Hyper-V
- **PowerShell**: Automation, advanced scripting, custom modules
- **Ansible**: Configuration management, multi-platform orchestration
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code, cloud and on-premise provisioning
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, Git, containerization, best practices
- **Security**: Hardening, compliance, auditing

### Why This Blog?

### My Philosophy

> "Automation is not an option, it's a necessity"

With 25 years of hindsight, I've learned that:
- Simplicity is preferable to complexity

- Knowledge sharing advances the entire community
